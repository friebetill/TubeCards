Since I was learning French with Anki at that time, I thought maybe I could apply Anki to physics as well.\n\nAfter a year of successfully learning physics with Anki, I wanted to share my flashcards with my friends and collaborate on them. Since this is only possible with Anki via plugins and these were outdated, I started to contribute to the development of a plugin.\n\nUnfortunately, the plugin is only usable by computer-savvy people. Due to the architecture of Anki, it is also not possible to simplify the plugin. Afterwards, I tried all sorts of flashcards apps and there were always things that bothered me. \n\nWhile on vacation with two friends, we started working on a new flashcards app and that's how TubeCards was born. Since then my two friends have started to work full time and I'm working almost alone on the app. But I'm not giving up, as I think that a really good flashcard app can greatly accelerate learning.",
