Since I was learning French with Anki at that time, I thought maybe I could apply Anki to physics as well.\n\nAfter a year of successfully learning physics with Anki, I wanted to share my flashcards with my friends and collaborate on them. Since this is only possible with Anki via plugins and these were outdated, I started to contribute to the development of a plugin.\n\nUnfortunately, the plugin is only usable by computer-savvy people. Due to the architecture of Anki, it is also not possible to simplify the plugin. Afterwards, I tried all sorts of flashcards apps and there were always things that bothered me. \n\nWhile on vacation with two friends, we started working on a new flashcards app and that's how TubeCards was born. Since then my two friends have started to work full time and I'm working almost alone on the app. But I'm not giving up, as I think that a really good flashcard app can greatly accelerate learning.","monthsAgoPOther":"${howMany} months ago","decksOne":"Deck","month":"Month","invites":"Invites","neutralSaying1":"Not bad","learnAsManyNewCardsAsYouCan":"Learn as many new cards as you can.","lastNameEnter":"Enter your last name","selectDeck":"Select deck","subscriber":"Subscriber","daysAgoOne":"a day ago","drawImage":"Draw image","inactive":"Inactive","subscribersPOther":"${howMany} Subscribers","sentRecoverInstructionsText":"We have sent the password recover instructions to your email.","learnDueCards":"Learn due cards","labelTheCardAsKnown":"Label the card as known","sunday":"Sunday","deleteDeckSubtitle":"Delete this deck","abortImport":"Abort import","clearQuery":"Clear query","moveTo":"Move to","aFreshStart":"A fresh start","camera":"Camera","importFromExcel":"Import from Excel","neutralSaying4":"Keep working on it","minutesOne":"1 minute","discard":"Discard","movingCard":"Moving card...","importExport":"Import / Export","move":"Move","pickImage":"Pick image","errorSelectExtensionText":"Please select a file with the extension \"${extension}\".","otherPlatforms":"Other platforms","home":"Home","macOSVersion":"macOS Version","anErrorOccured":"An error occured","leaveDeck":"Leave deck","export":"Export","positiveSaying1":"Awesome","successfullyAdded":"Successfully added card.","deckLink":"Deck link","stabilityExplanationText":"The memory stability shows how long you are able to answer your cards well.\n\nFor example, the memory stability of your name is very stable because it takes a long time until you forget your name.","thisTakesAFewSeconds":"This takes a few seconds","accountAdvantagesText":"This protects your data from a device loss and allows you to use TubeCards on multiple devices.","advanced":"Advanced","activeDecksSubtitleText":"Decide if you want to actively learn the deck","email":"Email","ratingsPOther":"ratings","missing":"Missing","thisUserAlreadyExists":"This user already exists.","memorized":"memorized","emptyCardListSubtitleText":"Your cards will appear here.","dueCardsExplanationText":"Due cards are cards you don't remember well, these are the cards you should review.\n\nFor example, a card you just created and learned will become due again in a few days because you won't remember it so well by then.","positiveSaying15":"Super-Duper","bold":"Bold","pickCover":"Pick cover","notificationSubtitle04":"No sweet without sweat.","passwordEnter":"Enter your password","shareYourDeck":"Share your deck","backText":"Back text","pickTextColor":"Pick text color","strengthExplanationText":"The memory strength shows the percentage of cards you can answer well.\n\nFor example, the strength of a card you just learned is at 100% because it is very likely that you remember that card.","learnCardsOne":"Only learn one card at a time","numberOfCardsPOther":"${howMany} cards","exportDeckSendEmailText":"When the export is complete, you will receive an email at ${email}.","resetPasswordInfoText":"Enter the email associated with your account and we'll send an email with instructions to reset your password.","createDeck":"Create deck","loadMoreDecks":"Load more decks","login":"Log in","thanksForReadingText":"Hopefully, with your help, continuing our work can be sustainable.
